## Investigations

Our longest standing investigation has been into the Chicago Police use of [cell site simulators](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/projects/stingray/) (commonly called Stingrays). In early January, Cook County Judge Kathleen Kennedy died the City's [motion to dismiss](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/chicago-police-must-finally-produce-stingray-records-judge-orders/) our lawsuit for records on the deployment of Stingrays. In April, our Director appeared at Georgetown's Center on Privacy and Technology conference "[The Color of Surveillance](http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/press-releases/the-color-of-surveillance-georgetown-law-conference-to-explore-racial-bias-of-government-monitoring.cfm)" to discuss how Stingrays use disproportionally impacts minority populations. On the legal front, LPL signed on to support the ACLU's [Citizen Privacy Protection Act](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/stingray/stingraybill/) which requires police departments in Illinois to obtain search warrants before using cell site simulators. This bill, IL SB2343, became law last year and is one of the most stringent bills regulating Stingray use in the country. And in October of this year, The Intercept [ran a report](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/18/how-chicago-police-convinced-courts-to-let-them-track-cellphones-without-a-warrant/) "How Chicago Police Convinced Courts to Let Them Track Cellphones Without a Warrant" which gave an overview on all the Stingray deployment records our FOIA lawsuit uncovered. 

Over a year and a half Lucy Parsons Labs investigated the use of Civil Asset Forfeiture by the Chicago Police Department. Civil Asset Forfeiture is the controversial legal process by which police departments can seize and move to keep the property of individuals, even in cases where they have not been convicted or even charged with a crime. LPL joined with reporter Joel Handley and the *Chicago Reader* to publish [Inside the Chicago Police Department’s secret budget](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-department-civil-forfeiture-investigation/Content?oid=23728922). It was revealed that since 2009, CPD has brought in nearly $72 million in cash and assets through civil forfeiture. While the vast majority of its spending was on the day to day operations of the War on Drugs, another significant use of the funds is to purchase controversial surveillance equipment including Automatic License Plate Readers, Stingrays, and Cellebrite.  None of these expenditures appear on an official City of Chicago budget but are instead quietly approved only by commanders in CPD's Bureau of Organized Crime. In order to collect this much data, LPL teamed up with [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/), a FOIA and transparency website, to have ordinary users submit FOIAs [on our behalf](http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/09/29/how-we-pulled-back-the-curtain-on-cpds-secret-spending). After gathering the data, we [visualized](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/fullaudit/) it and also made it possible to search for individual check. After our report came to light Mayor Rahm Emanuel's budget director, Alexandra Holt stated "We're putting tighter controls on them to make sure it's done in a way that's transparent" according to a report in the *Chicago Sun-Times*. Joel Handley described City Hall's [reaction](http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/10/03/city-hall-reacts-to-reader-revelations-about-the-chicago-police-departments-secret-budget) to our report in a follow up article in the *Chicago Reader*.

## Technology and Resources

Lucy Parsons Labs launched [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.lucyparsonslabs.com/), a project to improve police accountability using public and crowdsourced data. We maintain a database of police officers and provide a digital gallery that allows the public to identify the name and badge number of a police officer they would like to file a complaint about. Based on complaints data from the [Invisible Institute](http://invisible.institute/), from March 2011 - March 2015, 28% of complaints (4,000 total complaints) were immediately dropped due to no officer identification. OpenOversight seeks to fill this gap and also allows the community to upload images to our database. 

In order to better understand the surveillance landscape in Chicago, we developed a [primer on surveillance](https://redshiftzero.github.io/policesurveillance/). We provide an overview of all the technologies that we know are in use. We also used geo-tagging to build a map of every known POD, commonly called "blue light cameras" in Chicago. We describe the funding sources, efficacy as well as the legal and privacy concerns with each technology. 

Finally, we created a [resource](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/resources/) for identifying police officers who shoot and kill citizens in Chicago. Due to language in the Chicago Police Department’s contract officers who kill on the job are shielded from public disclosure. This leaves a challenge for families, the community, media and lawyers who seek to find more information about the deadly use of force. By working carefully through public records and collection of data we wrote a short guide on how to peel back this secrecy. 

## Community Outreach

One of the major initiative that Lucy Parsons Labs performs is digital security trainings to vulnerable members of the community. All of our trainings are free of charge and we have held countless trainings to activists, lawyers, and community groups. We have held trainings and talks on the use of secure messengers, QubesOS, and social media monitoring. After the 2016 election our group has been in high demand for these services.
