# Print Media 

Lucy Parsons Labs, in collaboration with local journalist Joel Handley and the Chicago Reader, has published an investigation of the use of civil asset forfeiture by Chicago Police. In the story, which you can read [in full on the Chicago Reader’s site](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-department-civil-forfeiture-investigation/Content?oid=23728922), we show how Chicago Police seize millions from citizens not necessarily convicted or even charged with a crime. We also show how they use this money to fund the operations of their narcotics units and buy controversial surveillance equipment. We also invite you to view the [full visualization of the results](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/fullaudit/) on the LPL website.

The Chicago Reader recently identified a Chicago Police Officer involved the [fatal shooting of an unarmed woman](http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/01/14/internal-police-records-point-to-the-identity-of-the-officer-who-fatally-shot-bettie-jones-and-quintonio-legrier). The identity was confirmed by public records requests created in collaboration with a journalist. Also in the Chicago Reader, members of the LPL were on a front-page article for contributing to [Cryptoparty Chicago](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/tales-from-the-crypto-party/Content?oid=17455111). Most LPL members are involved in teaching users security tools. As of 2015, LPL has been gathering documentation about the use of Cellebrite, a cell phone forensics company, in the Chicagoland area. Before the _Apple vs FBI_ controversy renewed interest in this area [North Star Post](http://nstarpost.com/17518/175572/a/cellebrite-what-you-need-to-know-about-cell-phone-forensics) published an expose on Cellebrite which relied on documents obtained by LPL.

During multiple lawsuits it was discovered that CPD was spending [hundreds of thousands of dollars](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/chicago-owes-lawyers-over-120000-for-defense-against-two-stingray-cases) to keep FOIA records from the public. After this came to light, [VICE](https://www.vice.com/read/stingrays-and-secrets-how-the-chicago-police-department-was-forced-to-come-clean-330/) sat down with Freddy Martinez, profiled his fight against CPD, tracked down the source of the money and discussed the ongoing legal fight.
