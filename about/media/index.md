# Print Media 

Lucy Parsons Labs, in collaboration with local journalist Joel Handley and the Chicago Reader, has published an investigation of the use of civil asset forfeiture by Chicago Police. In the story, which you can read [in full on the Chicago Reader’s site](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-department-civil-forfeiture-investigation/Content?oid=23728922), we show how Chicago Police seize millions from citizens not necessarily convicted or even charged with a crime. We also show how they use this money to fund the operations of their narcotics units and buy controversial surveillance equipment. We also invite you to view the [full visualization of the results](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/fullaudit/) on the LPL website. Other publications that ran stories on our investigation include [TechDirt](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161008/12004935747/documents-show-chicago-pd-secretly-using-forfeiture-funds-to-buy-surveillance-equipment.shtml) and [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2016/10/20/by-stealing-from-innocents-ch.html).

The Chicago Reader recently identified a Chicago Police Officer involved the [fatal shooting of an unarmed woman](http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/01/14/internal-police-records-point-to-the-identity-of-the-officer-who-fatally-shot-bettie-jones-and-quintonio-legrier). The identity was confirmed by public records requests created in collaboration with a journalist. Also in the Chicago Reader, members of the LPL were on a front-page article for contributing to [Cryptoparty Chicago](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/tales-from-the-crypto-party/Content?oid=17455111). Most LPL members are involved in teaching users security tools. As of 2015, LPL has been gathering documentation about the use of Cellebrite, a cell phone forensics company, in the Chicagoland area. Before the _Apple vs FBI_ controversy renewed interest in this area [North Star Post](http://nstarpost.com/17518/175572/a/cellebrite-what-you-need-to-know-about-cell-phone-forensics) published an expose on Cellebrite which relied on documents obtained by LPL.

Lucy Parsons Labs obtained numerous documents about how police departments in Cook County monitor and shape social media by monitoring the public. These document were reported on in [City Lab](http://www.citylab.com/crime/2016/12/how-police-are-watching-on-social-media/508991/) by journalist George Joseph who noted the slideshow in our records "explains that police can use “catfishing”—creating fake accounts—to get non-public social media data, even though such accounts are not permitted on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram." Joseph also notes that "Cook County Sheriff’s Office records suggest that intelligence analysts are also compiling information on persons of interest for longer term retention, not just for “situational awareness” at public events."

During multiple lawsuits it was discovered that CPD was spending [hundreds of thousands of dollars](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/chicago-owes-lawyers-over-120000-for-defense-against-two-stingray-cases) to keep FOIA records from the public. After this came to light, [VICE](https://www.vice.com/read/stingrays-and-secrets-how-the-chicago-police-department-was-forced-to-come-clean-330/) sat down with Freddy Martinez, profiled his fight against CPD, tracked down the source of the money and discussed the ongoing legal fight.

After a lengthy battle with the Chicago Police Department in the summer of 2014 over the purchases of Stringray devices, also known as IMSI Catchers, Freddy Martinez sued the CPD a second time. This second lawsuit sought the process in which CPD uses the cell phone tracking devices. EqualFuture covered the early beginnings of Lucy Parsons Labs. The full story [can be read here.](https://www.equalfuture.us/2015/11/25/lucy-parsons-labs-tech-chicago-activism/)

After a long court case for FOIA documents related to how CPD uses Stingrays, almost 300 pages were released to [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/18/how-chicago-police-convinced-courts-to-let-them-track-cellphones-without-a-warrant/) which ran a lengthy piece, "How Chicago Police Convinced Courts to Let Them Track Cellphones Without a Warrant".
