------------------------
The Lucy Parsons Labs is the process of registering as a 501c3 non-profit. At the moment, we are entirely self-funded but support would be accepted. If you'd like to support our GoFundMe fundraising drive, you can donate to our next year of operations [here](https://www.gofundme.com/transparency-in-chicago-government).

We have established a bitcoin wallet at [1JEwcx2gK5GYpFC1SAeXBCTX9mj2MjqSdE](https://blockchain.info/address/1JEwcx2gK5GYpFC1SAeXBCTX9mj2MjqSdE) if you'd like to donate funds to us pseudonymously.
